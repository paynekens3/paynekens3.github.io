## Featured Projects üíª

### 1. [Predictive Modeling for Customer Retention in Mobile Food Delivery üçî](https://github.com/paynekens3/Predictive-Modeling-for-Customer-Retention-in-Mobile-Food-Delivery)

**Overview:**  
In this project, I developed a **predictive model** to forecast customer churn for a mobile food delivery service. By analyzing **demographic** and **transactional** data, I built a model that helps the business identify customers who are at risk of leaving. The model empowers the service to implement targeted retention strategies.

**Key Skills:**  
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)  
- Predictive Analytics  
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  
- Model Evaluation and Metrics (ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix)

### 2. [Predictive Analytics for Hospital Readmission Rates üè•](https://github.com/paynekens3/-Predictive-Analytics-for-Hospital-Readmission-Rates-)

**Overview:**  
This project utilizes **machine learning techniques** to predict hospital readmissions by analyzing patient data such as **demographics** and **medical history**. The aim is to help healthcare providers identify patients at high risk for readmission, enabling the implementation of **preventative measures** and improving patient care.

**Key Skills:**  
- Machine Learning (Random Forests, XGBoost)  
- Data Visualization  
- Healthcare Data Analysis  
- Feature Selection and Engineering
